Project Statement: Flashcard Study Tool (Python)
1. Project Title
Flashcard Study Tool

2. Introduction
The Flashcard Study Tool is a Python-based command-line application designed to help users study efficiently using digital flashcards.
It enables users to create, store, review, and test themselves on a wide range of terms and definitions.
The program aims to replicate the functionality of physical flashcards while adding conveniences such as data persistence and automated quizzing.

4. Problem Statement

Traditional studying using physical flashcards can be time-consuming, difficult to organize, and not easily accessible across devices.
Students often struggle with:
Losing or damaging paper flashcards
Manually tracking progress
Keeping large sets of flashcards organized
Lack of automated quiz features

This project solves these issues by providing a lightweight, interactive, and portable flashcard tool that runs on any device with Python installed.

4. Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:
To develop a simple and user-friendly flashcard program in Python.
To allow users to create and manage their own flashcards.
To implement a quiz mode that tests user knowledge.


5. Scope

This project includes:
Creating, viewing, editing, and deleting flashcards
Randomized study mode
User quiz mode with scoring


6. Methodology

The project follows these steps:
Planning & requirement gathering
Implementation using Python features such as lists, dictionaries
Testing all features (creation, review, quiz, saving)
Documenting the project (README, statement file)

7. Expected Output

The program should allow the user to:
Enter new flashcards
Review flashcards one by one
Take quizzes
Load existing flashcards automatically on startup

8. Conclusion

The Flashcard Study Tool provides an efficient and portable solution for students and learners. By digitizing flashcards, the program enhances accessibility, organization, and studying effectiveness. It serves as a simple but powerful educational tool built entirely in Python.
